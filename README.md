# <div align ="center"> Welcome to my backend project!

#### As a part of my studies at Northcoders, I have been tasked with building an API for the purpose of accessing application data programmatically. The intention is to mimic the building of a real world backend service, gaining practical insight into the required workflows that will be common in the workplace.

## <div align ="center"> Part 1: Setup

#### This repo contains 2 databases for test and dev data. In order to connect to the two databases, .env files must be created. In the root directory, create a .env.test file, and include the following:

<br>

`PGDATABASE=nc_news_test`

<br>

#### Next, create a .env.development file, and include the following:

<br>

`PGDATABASE=nc_news`

<br>

All set!
