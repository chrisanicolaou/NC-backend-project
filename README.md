# Welcome to my backend project!

### As a part of my studies at Northcoders, I have been tasked with building an API for the purpose of accessing application data programmatically. The intention is to mimic the building of a real world backend service, gaining practical insight into the required workflows that will be common in the workplace.

## Part 1: Setup

This repo contains 2 databases for test and dev data. In order to connect to the two databases, .env files must be created. In the root directory, create a .env.test file, and include the following:

`PGDATABASE=nc_news_test`

Next, create a .env.development file, and include the following:

`PGDATABASE=nc_news`

All set!
